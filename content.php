The soil is black and full of nutrition, so the vege- tables and meat we will stew or stir fry quite a lot, sometimes we even eat the vegetables raw. How is this dish being prepared? It is really simple; You start of with washing the chicken feet. Then you boil some water, add dif- ferent spices and put the chicken feet in for 13 minutes, until it is 100% cooked. Take the chicken feet out and flush them under the cold water. Dip them into the pot with the chili, chicken powder, salt and white vinegar. A few hours or 1 day or more, and it’s is ready. At what moments do you eat this dish? Before the main dish. We eat it while talking, or chilling (for instance watching soccer game, play- ing poker etc.)';

It’s the head of a sheep, people here eat all the parts; the eyes , tongue, ears and the brain. Funny fact: We say that if you eat a lot of sheep brain you will become as stupid as a the sheep. How is this dish being prepared? No idea I will ask my grandmother for that. At what moments do you eat this dish? Usually we eat it in the ‘Aid Alkabir’, a religious celebration where we slaughter a sheep once a year to respect the tradition and to give to the poor people some meat. But it’s around all time in restaurants in jameelfna as seen on the picture.';

It’s main ingredients are stewed large intestines with misua, a kind of brown Taiwanese vermicelli. How is this dish being prepared? First you have to prepare the stock as the basic of the soup. Usually pork bone stock. And you stew the large intes- tines with soya sauce and other seasoning and herbs. Finally you cook the misua in the stock with intestines and other flavouring to taste, and serve with coriander on top. At what moments do you eat this dish? You can have it for breakfast, lunch or dinner. But it becomes more like a tourist thing nowadays. Originally it’s a very humble food which could be eaten as staple food by farmers when they’re busy working and don’t have a lot of time to cook.';

When you taste at the first moment is like rubber but after is special Can you tell us about a local delicacy? In Rome we eat Pagliata Romana! The dish can be found in some traditional trattorias in Rome. Pajata is the term for the intestines of an calf,only fed on its mother’s milk. It’s taste at first glance is to compare with, funny enough, rubber. But after this it’s very special. How is this dish being prepared? The intestines are cleaned and skinned, but the chyme is left inside. Then the intestine is cut in pieces 20 – 25 cm long, which are bound togeth- er with white thread, forming rings. They serve it with pasta and vegetables. At what moments do you eat this dish? It used to be a traditional food for the working class, so I guess after work. I sometimes have it in restaurants.';

$content['voedselverhalen']['col4']['Tripes']['description'] = 'I chose Tripes as it is a typical French dish. Tripes are made from the intestines of mostly beef. When you buy them at the butcher they already have been cooked for 24 hours, together with other intestines, stomach and beef feet. Traditionally Tripes are cooked in a stone pan and the lid is closed with pastry to prevent air to come into the pan during the long cooking (up to 5 hours). To the tripes you can add carrots, onions, garlic, thym, laurel or calvados/ white wine. Nowadays a good pan that closes well is sufficient. There are many recipes for tripes, the best one is the one you like the best. How is this dish being prepared? Put the tripes and a beef’s foot in a kettle and add cold water to cover. Bring to boil and cook 5 minutes, drain well. Then tie the onions, leeks, celery, garlic, bay leaves, thyme, cloves, parsley springs and peppercorns in a square of cheesecloth. Bring up the ends of the cloth and tie with a string to make a bundle. Put the tripe, calf’s foot pieces, carrots, the cheesecloth bundle, eight cups of the chicken broth, two cups of water, the wine and salt in a kettle and bring to boil. Cover closely and place in the oven. Bake for 5 hours. Skim off and discard most of the fat from the surface of the tripe. Remove and discard the cheesecloth bundle. Remove the carrots and cut them into one- quarter-inch rounds, add to the tripe. Remove the calf’s foot pieces, and cut away the gelatinous skin and discard the bones. Shred the skin and add to the tripe. Add the remaining one cup of chicken broth and bring to boil. Add the calvados, bring to boil again and serve! At what moments do you eat this dish? French have a hot meal for lunch and for dinner as well. You can eat this at both moments. It is also a dish you will find on a menu of any kind of restaurant that serves typical family French cuisine.';
